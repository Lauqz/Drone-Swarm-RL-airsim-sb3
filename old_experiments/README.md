# Old experiments

I leave them here in case they can be useful to anyone. All of them run, but some of them are buggy (especially the ones not using SB3, PettingZoo and SuperSuit).
A list of the ones I remember:

* `projectrl_multi_stablebaselines_stacked` - The stacked observation experiment. Can be run with the multi-agent env.
* `projectrl_multi_ray` - Approach using Ray's RLlib.
* `projectrl_multi_marllib` - Approach using MARLLib.

I have further ones but I don't think they deserve a position here. If you need, contact me.
